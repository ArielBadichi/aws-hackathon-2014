## Employee Directory ##

### Sample Mobile/PhoneGap Application built with Backbone.js, RequireJS and Topcoat ###

"Backbone Directory" is a simple Employee Directory application built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org), [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), and [Topcoat] (http://topcoat.io).

Refer to [this blog](http://coenraets.org) for more information about the application.


The application runs out-of-the-box with an in-memory data store.

If you want to experiment the application with other persistence layers, download the REST services in the following repositories:

- [directory-rest-php](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-rest-php) (PHP implementation)
